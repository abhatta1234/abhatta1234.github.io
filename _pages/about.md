Hello and Welcome to my webpage. I hope you are doing well!! ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ <br><br>
I am a third year Computer Science and Engineering PhD student at the University of Notre Dame. I am advised by Dr. Kevin Bowyer and a member of Computer Vision Research Laboratory([CVRL](https://cvrl.nd.edu/)). I received my Bachelor's Degree with Honors in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Mississippi. 

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on deep-learning, computer vision, biometrics, and explainable/responsible AI. Specifically, I explore various computer vision challenges such as recognition, detection/segmentation, and developing efficient deep-learning models and training pipelines. Additionally, I am interested in understanding the behavior of deep-learning networks and mitigating adversarial outcomes before deployment. Currently, my research centers on face recognition, aiming to uncover and address accuracy differentials among demographic groups to promote fairness in AI systems.
