Hello and Welcome to my webpage. I hope you are doing well!! ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ <br><br>
I am a second year Computer Science and Engineering PhD student at the University of Notre Dame. I am a member of Computer Vision Research Laboratory([CVRL](https://cvrl.nd.edu/)). I am very blessed and fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Kevin W. Bowyer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XZkvOTEAAAAJ&hl=en). 

I received my Bachelor's Degree with Honors in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Mississippi. I was very fortunate to have worked across different domains and mentored by wonderful researchers throughout my undegraduate studies. I have worked on projects in studying evolution of fungal-algal mutualism working with [Dr. Erik F.Y. Hom](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EQpJP8cAAAAJ&hl=en), designing efficient heat transfer systems using piezoelectric agitators and micro pin fin arrays working with [Dr. Taiho Yeom](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=2wq2ly4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and studying economics and impacts of solar energy working with [Dr. Tejas Pandya](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=qAz_-1wAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). My undegradaute honors thesis can be found [here](https://github.com/abhatta1234/abhatta1234.github.io/blob/4f6584f201bc2b3c835941e17a3a9ad73fcf2cd7/files/undergrad_honors_thesis.pdf)

Research Interests
======
My primary research interest is in the broader field of explainable/responsible AI, where the main goal is to understand why deep-learning networks behave the way they do and how to mitigate their adversarial outcomes. Currently, my graduate research work is focused on face recognition where I try to understand the causes behind the accuracy differentials across different demographic groups and try to mitigate them.
