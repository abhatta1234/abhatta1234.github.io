## About Me & Research Interests
Hello and Welcome to my webpage. I hope you are doing well!! ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ <br><br>
I am a third year Computer Science and Engineering PhD student at the University of Notre Dame. I am advised by Dr. Kevin Bowyer and a member of Computer Vision Research Laboratory([CVRL](https://cvrl.nd.edu/)). I received my Bachelor's Degree with Honors in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Mississippi. 

I have a broad interest in research topics related to deep learning and computer vision. Specifically, in the long run, I aim to pursue a research career focused on **long-range video understanding and generation**. I believe this is only possible using multi-modality by harnessing the features from text, videos, and audios combined. My current PhD research projects primarily concentrate on face recognition, with a particular emphasis on uncovering and addressing accuracy differentials among demographic groups to promote fairness in AI systems.
