Hi! I hope you are doing well!!
I am a second year CSE PhD student at the University of Notre Dame. I am a member of Computer Vision Research Laboratory([CVRL](https://cvrl.nd.edu/)). I am very blessed and fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Kevin W. Bowyer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XZkvOTEAAAAJ&hl=en). 

I received my Bachelor's Degree with Honors in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Mississippi. I was very fortunate to have worked across different domains and mentored by wonderful researchers. I have worked on projects in studying evolution of fungal-algal mutualism working with [Dr. Erik F.Y. Hom](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EQpJP8cAAAAJ&hl=en), designing efficient heat transfer systems using piezoelectric agitators and micro pin fin arrays working with [Dr. Taiho Yeom](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=2wq2ly4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and studying economics and impacts of solar energy working with [Dr. Tejas Pandya](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=qAz_-1wAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). My undegradaute thesis can be found [here]().
