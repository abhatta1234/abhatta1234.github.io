My name is Aman Bhatta and I am currently a **third year Ph.D. student** at the University of Notre Dame in the Computer Science and Engineering department. My research focuses on developing new deep-learning-based **computer vision approaches** with a particular emphasis on face recognition and addressing accuracy differentials among demographic groups to promote fairness in AI systems. My doctoral advisor is [Dr. Kevin Bowyer](https://cvrl.nd.edu/) and I am a member of Computer Vision Research Laboratory ([CVRL](https://cvrl.nd.edu/)).

Previously, I received a Bachelor's Degree with Honors in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Mississippi. I have broad interests in research topics related to deep learning and computer vision, specifically long-range video understanding and generation using multi-modality by harnessing features from text, videos, and audios combined.
