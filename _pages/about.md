Hello and Welcome to my webpage. I hope you are doing well!! ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ <br><br>
I am a second year Computer Science and Engineering PhD student at the University of Notre Dame. I am a member of Computer Vision Research Laboratory([CVRL](https://cvrl.nd.edu/)). I am very blessed and fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Kevin W. Bowyer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XZkvOTEAAAAJ&hl=en). 

I received my Bachelor's Degree with Honors in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Mississippi. I was very fortunate to have worked across different domains and mentored by wonderful researchers throughout my undegraduate studies. I have worked on projects in studying evolution of fungal-algal mutualism working with [Dr. Erik F.Y. Hom](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EQpJP8cAAAAJ&hl=en), designing efficient heat transfer systems using piezoelectric agitators and micro pin fin arrays working with [Dr. Taiho Yeom](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=2wq2ly4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and studying economics and impacts of solar energy working with [Dr. Tejas Pandya](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=qAz_-1wAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on deep-learning, computer vision, biometrics, and explainable/responsible AI. Specifically, I explore various computer vision challenges such as recognition, detection/segmentation, and developing efficient deep-learning models and training pipelines. Additionally, I am interested in understanding the behavior of deep-learning networks and mitigating adversarial outcomes before deployment. Currently, my research centers on face recognition, aiming to uncover and address accuracy differentials among demographic groups to promote fairness in AI systems.
