# Abstract

Thorough evaluation is critical for developing models that
are fair and robust. In this work, we describe the Conditional
Attribute Subsampling Toolkit (CAST) for selecting data sub-
sets for fine-grained scientific evaluations. Our toolkit effi-
ciently filters data given an arbitrary number of conditions
for metadata attributes. The purpose of the toolkit is to al-
low researchers to easily to evaluate models on targeted test
distributions. The functionality of CAST is demonstrated
on the WebFace42M face Recognition dataset. We calcu-
late over 50 attributes for this dataset including race, image
quality, facial features, and accessories. Using our toolkit,
we create over a hundred test sets conditioned on one or
multiple attributes. Results are presented for subsets of vari-
ous demographics and image quality ranges. Using eleven
different subsets, we build a face recognition 1:1 verification
benchmark called C11 that exclusively contains pairs that
are near the decision threshold. Evaluation on C11 with
state-of-the-art methods demonstrates the suitability of the
proposed benchmark.
