# Abstract
It is broadly accepted that there is a “gender gap” in
face recognition accuracy, with females having lower accu-
racy. However, relatively little is known about the cause(s)
of this gender gap. We first demonstrate that female and
male hairstyles have important differences that impact face
recognition accuracy. In particular, variation in male facial
hair contributes to a greater average difference in appear-
ance between different male faces. We then demonstrate
that when the data used to evaluate recognition accuracy is
gender-balanced for how hairstyles occlude the face, the
initially observed gender gap in accuracy largely disap-
pears. We show this result for two different matchers, and
for a Caucasian image dataset and an African-American
dataset. Our results suggest that research on demographic
variation in accuracy should include a check for balanced
quality of the test data as part of the problem formula-
tion. This new understanding of the causes of the gender
gap in recognition accuracy will hopefully promote ratio-
nal consideration of what might be done about it. To pro-
mote reproducible research, the matchers, attribute classi-
fiers, and datasets used in this work are available to other
researchers.
