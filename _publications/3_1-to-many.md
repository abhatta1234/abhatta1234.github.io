# Abstract

Demographic disparities in face recognition accuracy have received negative coverage in the media. Concern about the impact of accuracy disparities often focuses on instances of false arrest after 1-to-many facial identification. This work investigates accuracy disparities in 1-to-many matching across male/ female and African-American/Caucasian demographics. We compare the accuracy of rank-one 1-to-many facial identification across demographics using the dâ€™ separation between mated and non-mated score distributions, using a non-parametric value for the separation in the tails of the mated and non-mated distributions, and the distributions of (mated - non-mated) difference values. Our results indicate that rank-one 1-to-many identification accuracy is best for African-American male, followed by Caucasian male, Caucasian female and African-American female. Females have lower accuracy than males, and the  accuracy difference between African-American male and Caucasian male is the smallest of the differences.
