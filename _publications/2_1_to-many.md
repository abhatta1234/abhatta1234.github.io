# Abstract

Demographic disparities in face recognition accuracy
have received negative coverage in the media. Concern
about the impact of accuracy disparities often focuses on
instances of false arrest after 1-to-many facial identifica-
tion. This work investigates accuracy disparities in 1-to-
many matching across male / female and African-American
/ Caucasian demographics. We compare the accuracy of
rank-one 1-to-many facial identification across demograph-
ics using the d’ separation between mated and non-mated
score distributions, using a non-parametric value for the
separation in the tails of the mated and non-mated distri-
butions, and the distributions of (mated - non-mated) dif-
ference values. Our results indicate that rank-one 1-to-
many identification accuracy is best for African-American
male, followed by Caucasian male, Caucasian female and
African-American female. Females have lower accuracy
than males, and the accuracy difference between African-
American male and Caucasian male is the smallest of the
differences.
